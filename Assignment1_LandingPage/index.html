      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Across the world, the young people who leave education today are, on
        average, more highly qualified than any preceding generation in history.
        They often enter the working world with considerably more years of
        schooling than their parents or grandparents. This is an enormous
        achievement of which the global education community can be truly proud.
        And yet, in spite of completing an unprecedented number of years of
        formal education, young people continue to struggle in the job market,
        and governments continue to worry about the mismatch between what
        societies and economies demand and education systems supply. The
        coexistence of unemployed university graduates and employers who say
        they cannot find people with the skills they need, shows that more
        education does not automatically mean better jobs and better lives. For
        many young people, academic success alone has proved an insufficient
        means of ensuring a smooth transition into good employment. I firmly
        believe that education is the fundamental driving force for social
        progress. With the world of work changing so quickly, there is strong
        reason to believe that schools need to look afresh at how they can
        better prepare young people for their lives. The industrial age taught
        us how to educate second-class robots, people who learn in standardised
        settings and become good at repeating what we tell them. In this age of
        accelerations, we need to think harder about what makes us firstclass
        humans, how we complement, not substitute, the artificial intelligence
        we have created in our computers, and how we build a culture that
        facilitates learning, unlearning and re-learning throughout life. The
        new generation of citizens requires not just strong academic skills, but
        also curiosity, imagination, empathy, entrepreneurship and resilience.
        They need confidence and determination to create their own employment
        and to manage their careers in new ways. Effective education systems
        will go beyond traditional teaching techniques. Not only will they
        provide learners with knowledge relevant to future employment, they will
        also develop the ability of learners to be personally effective in
        applying that knowledge in changing situations.
